**STUDENT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM**

The Student Management System (SMS) is designed to manage various aspects of student and course information within an educational institution.

Hereâ€™s a brief overview of how it works and the SQL code used:


**Table Creation:**

Students: Stores student details (ID, Name, BirthDate).
Courses: Stores course details (ID, CourseName, Credits).
Enrollments: Manages the many-to-many relationship between students and courses (StudentID, CourseID, EnrollmentDate).
